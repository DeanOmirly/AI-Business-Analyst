# 📊 AI-Powered Business Data Analyst Assistant

This project is a data analysis assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini and LangChain, built with a Streamlit front end. It enables business analysts to upload CSV datasets and receive automated insights, Python code, visualizations, and explanations for various types of business-related analyses such as customer churn, forecasting, financial modeling, etc.

## 🔍 Features
- Upload a CSV file of your dataset
- Ask any business-related analytical question (e.g., "What drives churn in this dataset?" or "Forecast future revenue")
- Get Python code + explanation auto-generated by an LLM
- Option to execute the suggested code and display output within the app
- Visualize data insights directly in Streamlit

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-data-analysis-assistant.git
cd ai-data-analysis-assistant
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add your OpenAI API Key
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

### 5. Run the App
```bash
streamlit run ai_data_analyst_app.py
```

## ⚠️ Cautions
- This app executes Python code from the LLM. Although it is sandboxed to data operations, use caution with unfamiliar code.
- Do not upload sensitive, private, or proprietary data.

## 📂 Dataset Used
`Bank Customer Churn Prediction` dataset from Kaggle.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add chart interactivity with Plotly
- Enable multi-turn question chaining
- Add session memory for longer analysis workflows
- Deploy on Streamlit Cloud
